# eidl7zip

This conda package was originally developed for the [EcoInventDownLoader (eidl)](https://github.com/haasad/EcoInventDownLoader). For Windows it provides the command-line version of [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (version 9.20), for Linux and OSX [p7zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/) (version 16.02). Both projects are licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html). The conda recipe and the build scripts for this package are available on [github](https://github.com/haasad/eidl7zip). This github repo uses travis and appveyor to automatically package 7zip/p7zip for conda.
